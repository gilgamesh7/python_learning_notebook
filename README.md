# python_learning_notebook
A generic Python learning notebook to try out snippets from videos and tweets

- To use the marimo notebook : marimo edit python_learning.py
- The weather.py and tests directory do not use Marimo - confuses pytest. To run tests, use "pytest" - See [How to Write Great Unit Tests in Python](https://youtu.be/EIV_ixKGPmc?si=JX3WigoUmfiy-Ccz)
